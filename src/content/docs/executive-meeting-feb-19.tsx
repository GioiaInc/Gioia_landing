        Full team meeting — Saeed, Roman, Enis, and Kambar. Centered on three
        things: Enis&apos; design evolution presentation, preparing for Saeed&apos;s
        investor/mentor call, and the Tuesday demo deadline.
      </p>

      <h2>Enis&apos; Design Journey Presentation</h2>
      <p>
        Enis walked the team through the complete visual evolution of Balo — from
        the earliest concepts to the current direction. This was the most
        comprehensive design review to date.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.2rem' }}>Four design beliefs</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>No more grids.</strong> Traditional messaging apps trap contacts
          into rigid rows and columns. Grids feel mechanical and lifeless. Balo
          uses organic, spatial layouts where position itself communicates
          meaning.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Faces, not names.</strong> In real life, we recognize people by
          their face — not by reading a name tag. Avatars are front-facing
          photos because that&apos;s how we actually identify the people we care
          about.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Golden circle.</strong> The two people you talk to most are
          centered on screen. The next closest connections form an inner ring
          (the &quot;golden circle&quot;). Everyone else orbits outward. Proximity equals
          closeness.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Auras with meaning.</strong> The colored glow behind each
          contact isn&apos;t decorative — it encodes the nature of your conversation.
          Different colors, different meanings. Every aura is alive.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.2rem' }}>Design evolution</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Bubble concept</strong> — floating soap bubbles and orbs in
          cosmic space. Beautiful as a visual experience, but too abstract. The
          bubbles didn&apos;t say anything about the people inside them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Illustrated avatars</strong> — Modigliani-inspired faces as
          front-facing placeholders. Screen was too dense, too many elements
          fighting for attention.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Early Balo</strong> — brought density back with better
          hierarchy. People who glow most are people you talk to most. Added
          name tags and timestamps. Closer, but still not right.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Orbital breakthrough</strong> — major turning point. Contacts
          centered around the person you talk to most, golden circle of closest
          connections, glowing aura rings. Still looked too much like a game.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Refinements</strong> — replaced illustrations with real photos,
          added spacing for visual breathing room, introduced profile placement
          (bottom-left with wave animation), removed contact backgrounds to show
          only faces with surrounding energy waves.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Current direction</strong> — the culmination. Real front-facing
          photos, no names, colored auras encoding conversation tone, subtle
          golden circle, clean and alive.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Aura Design System</h2>
      <p>
        Enis presented the complete color-emotion mapping system. Core principle:
        one carefully curated warm-to-cool spectrum anchored to Balo&apos;s signature
        purple. No disconnected rainbow — every color harmonizes.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.2rem' }}>Six conversation tones</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Calm &amp; Reflective</strong> (cool blue) — supportive,
          thoughtful conversations. Aura moves slowly, like a deep breath.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Balanced &amp; Everyday</strong> (soft purple) — the default
          neutral state. Regular catching up, sharing plans. Balo&apos;s signature
          baseline that all other states depart from and return to.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Deep &amp; Passionate</strong> (rose coral) — heartfelt
          emotional conversations. Deep confessions, expressions of love, raw
          honesty. Aura moves with gentle urgency, particles swirling with
          warmth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Celebratory &amp; Excited</strong> (warm gold) — high energy,
          joyful exchanges. The most dynamic aura — fastest motion, brightest
          and most expansive glow.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Warm &amp; Intense</strong> (deep amber) — passionate debates,
          vigorous exchange of ideas, strong opinions. Intense but constructive.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dormant Connection</strong> (faded mist) — conversations gone
          quiet. The connection remains but the aura is barely visible, barely
          moving. A ghost of what it was, waiting to be rekindled.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.2rem' }}>Three dimensions of expression</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Hue</strong> — derived from sentiment analysis of recent
          messages.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Saturation</strong> — how vivid or washed out. Active, frequent
          conversations produce rich saturated auras. Inactive ones desaturate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Motion</strong> — speed and dynamism of particle animation.
          Longer, more expressive messages drive faster, more active waves.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.2rem' }}>Design rules</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Blend, never snap.</strong> Colors transition smoothly between
          states. No jarring jumps.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Layer two tones.</strong> Each aura has a primary and secondary
          color for depth and complexity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No green, no rainbow.</strong> Green clashes with the purple
          palette. Stay within the warm-hue spectrum. If more than two hues are
          visible at once, they must still feel cohesive.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Saturation tells the story.</strong> Vibrant = active
          connection. Desaturated = dormant.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Keep it dusty.</strong> Colors should feel slightly muted
          compared to pure hues. This maintains Balo&apos;s premium, moody aesthetic.
          Never use pure primaries — always drift toward the purple family.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Investor/Mentor Preparation</h2>
      <p>
        Saeed shared updates on two key contacts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>San Francisco contact</strong> — can introduce Saeed to an
          angel fund connected to Stanford student founders. This contact is
          actively helping GIOIA refine its materials, which is partly why the
          landing page and demo are being prioritized.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>LinkedIn contact (call scheduled Feb 20)</strong> — experienced
          corporate innovation professional. Background spans Wall Street (~10
          years), cloud computing, telecom, AI services, venture capital.
          Currently at a major Kazakh telecom. Responded quickly and seems
          genuinely interested. Saeed is approaching this as a mentorship, not a
          pitch — just introducing GIOIA, what the team is building, and what
          makes it stand out.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The team discussed what to emphasize on the call. Roman suggested
        framing GIOIA as &quot;an experiment in what business looks like in the AI
        age&quot; — the entire team is AI-native, which is a genuine differentiator
        that most companies in the region (and globally) cannot claim.
      </p>

      <h2>Tuesday Demo</h2>
      <p>
        Saeed committed to having a demo ready by Tuesday for the San Francisco
        contact. Roman offered to build it — a video simulation of the app
        experience with emotional aura effects, rendered inside a phone outline.
        Not a live app demo, but a designed sequence showing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A user opening the app and seeing the orbital contact layout</li>
        <li>Entering a conversation</li>
        <li>Sending messages with emotional content</li>
        <li>Aura/mood visuals responding in real time</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Roman has a background in motion graphics and can build this using a
        separate framework from the actual app, with visual fidelity matching
        Enis&apos; designs. Output will be a high-quality video.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dependencies:</strong> Enis to finalize the chat interface design
        by Saturday. Saeed to define the demo flow (what sequence of events to
        show). Roman builds the animation Sunday–Tuesday.
      </p>

      <h2>Landing Page Review</h2>
      <p>
        The team reviewed Saeed&apos;s current landing page (vibe-coded). Roman gave
        candid feedback:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Content and messaging are strong, good length overall.
        </li>
        <li>
          The text reads as AI-generated — it needs Saeed&apos;s authentic voice.
          Recommendation: Saeed rewrites the hero section entirely in his own
          words, then writes the first sentence of each subsequent section so
          the AI can match his style for the rest.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some claims are potentially misleading (e.g., &quot;80 million people&quot; at
          the bottom could be misread as a user count by someone skimming).
        </li>
        <li>
          Design-wise: too much purple-on-white, overly glowy bold text. Roman
          will redesign it properly — has done 100+ landing pages and expects a
          quick turnaround.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Kambar will handle the Russian translation once the English version is
        finalized.
      </p>

      <h2>Digital Twin — Quick Note</h2>
      <p>
        Kambar confirmed that digital twin processing must be server-side.
        On-device is not viable — phones cannot handle the full context
        generation and embedding computation required to build meaningful user
        profiles. This settles the earlier open question from the Feb 15 meeting.
      </p>

      <h2>Chat Interface Design</h2>
      <p>
        Enis shared a first draft of the in-chat messaging interface. Early
        reactions: the top navigation bar looks good, but the overall design
        leans too heavily into Apple&apos;s Liquid Glass aesthetic. Saeed and Roman
        both flagged this — Balo needs its own identity, not something that
        looks like a copy. Enis acknowledged and is iterating. Font changes are
        also planned. Finalized version expected by Saturday.
      </p>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Enis:</strong> Finalize chat interface design by Saturday.
          Share updated Figma (finalized screens draft). Continue working with
          Saeed on messaging page emotional design.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Roman:</strong> Build demo video by Tuesday. Redesign landing
          page this weekend. Collect and ship bug fix update by Tuesday.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Saeed:</strong> Rewrite landing page hero section in own
          words. Define demo flow script for Roman. Call with LinkedIn
          mentor contact tomorrow. Continue working with Enis on chat interface.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Kambar:</strong> Russian translation of landing page once
          English is finalized.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Standout Quotes</h2>
      <p style={{ fontStyle: 'italic', color: '#6a6560' }}>
        &quot;We&apos;re an experiment in what business looks like in the AI age.&quot;

      <p style={{ fontStyle: 'italic', color: '#6a6560' }}>
        &quot;We&apos;re guaranteed connections. We just have to build something that
        works. If that&apos;s not motivating, I don&apos;t know what is.&quot;
        <br />— Saeed
      </p>
      <p style={{ fontStyle: 'italic', color: '#6a6560' }}>
